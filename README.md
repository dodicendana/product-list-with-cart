# Coding Challenge - Product List with Cart

This project was built to fetch product list and product details, as well as leave comments and rating for chosen products.
It was built using React framework, along with libraries like axios, node-sass, & react-router.

## Web App

This is the Web App of the Coding Challenge - Product List with Cart, which is a small application to mimic some of the functionalities on ecommerce app, such as viewing list of products information, such as name, description, & price, as well as adding thos products into a cart.
It consumes one Mocky API to get list of products:

- [Get Product List](https://run.mocky.io/v3/d411823c-4e13-4079-8409-028f03add07a)

It is bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & has some additional third-party library, such as:

- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - It is used for managing back end API calls. All API calls in this web app are done through Axios service.
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) - It is used to manage states, such as product information & list of items in cart.
- [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) - It is middleware for React-Redux.
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - It is used to manage routing inside of the React app.
- [Node-Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) - It is used to compile .scss files to css files to be consumed for stylings.
